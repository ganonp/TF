# TF

The Term Frequency program works by running the main method of ConsoleProgram which requests two inputs from the user:  
  
The directory containing the documents (including the trailing \\).  
The list of words (separated by spaces).  
It then outputs a list of words and their respective document names, and frequencies.  

# Example
Please enter directory containing document set (include final \\):  
C:\Users\Teresa\IdeaProjects\TF\SampleDocs\  
  
Please enter word list:
